                    <p>The Secure Software Development module is more intensive to allow students to apply the
                        fundamental principles we learned in previous modules. We are supposed to examine security risks
                        associated with programming languages from the perspectives of design and architecture
                        approaches, programming paradigms, testing, the impact and implications of operating systems and
                        libraries on software development, the security risks associated with distributed systems and
                        APIs, and future trends in secure software and systems design.</p>
                    <p>We learned about secure development methodologies and best practices for designing safe and
                        compliant software over the course of twelve weeks. </p>
                    <p>UML remains the most effective tool in describing different components and their interaction
                        within a system in this module. I had a chance to review my knowledge of UML diagrams by
                        illustrating the steps to exploit one of the weaknesses identified by OWASP. We also teamed up
                        this week to prepare for the group assignment. </p>
                    <p>The first team activity was to analyze how secured Python is and determine what factors define
                        the safety of a programming language. Along with that, I was exploring the use of regular
                        expressions and recursion in creating software solutions to better understand the concepts and
                        the pros and cons of both approaches. It was a surprise to know that we could get the maximum
                        recursion depth in Python and set it to the desired number. There is no pre-set minimum
                        recursion depth in most languages, causing overflow of the stack and crash the program. Learning
                        how to avoid ReDOS was another great experience while exploring the usage of regular expressions
                        (Regex)</p>
                    <p>The next team discussion was to explore the cyclomatic complexity and a few other testing tools
                        available in Python. The coding activity covered a wide range of test cases where I can compare
                        different testing tools and linters in terms of their efficiency in enforcing the coding format
                        and analyzing the inconsistency in the coding convention. </p>
                    <p>Our team was supposed to deliver the design document of a secure repository by the end of unit 6.
                        The goal was to focus on the security aspects and apply as many proper tools and techniques as
                        possible to secure our application. In addition, we got to think about the system's scalability
                        and how it would comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
                        . I struggled at first, learning how to work with teammates from different professions and
                        backgrounds. Time management and communication are soft skills that I have improved during this
                        time. Because of the time-zone difference, I can rarely attend live seminars. Thankfully, one of
                        my teammates was supportive in keeping our team and the tutor engaged so we could constantly get
                        feedback for our work.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the next couple of units, we kept diving into other security aspects by doing some coding
                        activities and studying cryptography in connection with the operating systems to figure out why
                        it is crucial to encrypt the data. A case study was brought up in our forum discussion regarding
                        TrueCrypt's discontinuation of development. Besides the exciting story of its creator's
                        anonymity, it seems to me that some fundamental software engineering principles are missing in
                        the TrueCrypt project. Most of the vulnerabilities pointed out by the security audit evaluation
                        of the software itself illustrate a lack of software development best practices and proper
                        quality control processes. </p>
                    <p>Continuing to expand my knowledge on the capabilities of different Python libraries, I went
                        through a section to develop a restful API for a distributed environment to prepare for our
                        final submission in unit 11 – the coding output. I would consider this was a heavy module due to
                        our lack of knowledge of available Python libraries. We chose to use Python and the Flask
                        framework to inherit the knowledge from the previous modules. The knowledge inheritance helped
                        us build out a foundational structure for our system; the challenging part was trying out,
                        selecting, and plugging the right tools into our application. Not all the features we designed
                        have been fully implemented, but our team has given effort and attention to incorporating as
                        many aspects of learning from this module to the submission.</p>
                    <p>I'm leaving the module realizing that security is now a requirement for software development and
                        should not be taken lightly. Most vulnerabilities are found in the application's source code
                        rather than in other layers. Fortunately, most common software security flaws can be mitigated
                        by adhering to well-established secure coding standards.</p>
