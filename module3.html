					<p>The Secure Software Development module is more intensive to allow students to apply the
						fundamental principles we learned in previous modules. We are supposed to examine security risks
						associated with programming languages from the perspectives of design and architecture
						approaches, programming paradigms, testing, the impact and implications of operating systems and
						libraries on software development, the security risks associated with distributed systems and
						APIs, and future trends in secure software and systems design.</p>
					<p>We learned about secure development methodologies and best practices for designing safe and
						compliant software over the course of twelve weeks. </p>
					<p>UML remains the most effective tool in describing different components and their interaction
						within a system in this module. I had a chance to review my knowledge of UML diagrams by
						illustrating the steps to exploit one of the weaknesses identified by OWASP. We also teamed up
						this week to prepare for the group assignment. </p>
					<p>The first team activity was to analyze how secured Python is and determine what factors define
						the safety of a programming language. Along with that, I was exploring the use of regular
						expressions and recursion in creating software solutions to better understand the concepts and
						the pros and cons of both approaches. It was a surprise to know that we could get the maximum
						recursion depth in Python and set it to the desired number. There is no pre-set minimum
						recursion depth in most languages, causing overflow of the stack and crash the program. Learning
						how to avoid ReDOS was another great experience while exploring the usage of regular expressions
						(Regex)</p>
					<p>The next team discussion was to explore the cyclomatic complexity and a few other testing tools
						available in Python. The coding activity covered a wide range of test cases where I can compare
						different testing tools and linters in terms of their efficiency in enforcing the coding format
						and analyzing the inconsistency in the coding convention. </p>
					<p>Our team was supposed to deliver the design document of a secure repository by the end of unit 6.
						The goal was to focus on the security aspects and apply as many proper tools and techniques as
						possible to secure our application. In addition, we got to think about the system's scalability
						and how it would comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
						. I struggled at first, learning how to work with teammates from different professions and
						backgrounds. Time management and communication are soft skills that I have improved during this
						time. Because of the time-zone difference, I can rarely attend live seminars. Thankfully, one of
						my teammates was supportive in keeping our team and the tutor engaged so we could constantly get
						feedback for our work.
					</p>
					<p>In the next couple of units, we kept diving into other security aspects by doing some coding
						activities and studying cryptography in connection with the operating systems to figure out why
						it is crucial to encrypt the data. A case study was brought up in our forum discussion regarding
						TrueCrypt's discontinuation of development. Besides the exciting story of its creator's
						anonymity, it seems to me that some fundamental software engineering principles are missing in
						the TrueCrypt project. Most of the vulnerabilities pointed out by the security audit evaluation
						of the software itself illustrate a lack of software development best practices and proper
						quality control processes. </p>
					<p>Continuing to expand my knowledge on the capabilities of different Python libraries, I went
						through a section to develop a restful API for a distributed environment to prepare for our
						final submission in unit 11 â€“ the coding output. I would consider this was a heavy module due to
						our lack of knowledge of available Python libraries. We chose to use Python and the Flask
						framework to inherit the knowledge from the previous modules. The knowledge inheritance helped
						us build out a foundational structure for our system; the challenging part was trying out,
						selecting, and plugging the right tools into our application. Not all the features we designed
						have been fully implemented, but our team has given effort and attention to incorporating as
						many aspects of learning from this module to the submission.</p>
					<p>I'm leaving the module realizing that security is now a requirement for software development and
						should not be taken lightly. Most vulnerabilities are found in the application's source code
						rather than in other layers. Fortunately, most common software security flaws can be mitigated
						by adhering to well-established secure coding standards.</p>
