					<p>The Network and Information Security Management module aims to provide students with an
						understanding of security concepts and terminology and hands-on experience with one of the most
						critical aspects of information security today â€“ network technology. We had a chance to explore
						the essential penetration testing tools in a practical manner, improve our awareness of various
						security standards and policies, and design and execute a security assessment on a web
						application. </p>
					<p>We discussed the STRIDE and DREAD methodology at the beginning of the module to see how they will
						be applied in determining and ranking the threats. Later in the assignment, it was interesting
						to determine that these methodologies are just a proportion of a more extensive threat modelling
						process. Many other elements need to be considered, such as external dependencies, assets, trust
						levels, and data flow (OWASP, n.d.). However, the website was almost a black box when we carried
						out the assessment as we had no knowledge of how the website operated internally. From a risk
						management perspective, there should be another security assessment for the internal components
						to identify the threats. Unfortunately, this requirement is out of the scope of the assignments.
					</p>
					<p>Gathering information about the desired target is one of the essential engagement activities
						before we conduct the assignment. Kali is my tool of choice for this purpose. It is
						intentionally designed and packed with security-related tools to support network and computer
						security experts in performing ethical hacking and penetration testing (Leroux, S., 2020). I
						experimented with myself on a personal system where Kali is installed virtually on Parallels.
						The purpose was to gain as much knowledge as possible on Kali's tools and apply them to perform
						scans against the assigned website. Setting up the network connection on Parallels was the first
						challenge. Initially, running the traceroute command on Kali only returns one hop. I finally
						figured out that Bridge Network Adapter should be used instead of Shared Network Adapter to
						enable proper network connection.</p>
					<p>One of my classmates asked an interesting question during our scanning exercise, asking why the
						tool was returning a different server's physical location for us. This raises a concern about
						the result accuracy of the penetration tools. Even though we had an activity to review some
						tools during the module, which resulted in <a target="_blank"
							href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLmS0AeEIxHvhUWjQn63ZKZbdKQsIAES/edit">the
							outcome</a>, more in-depth research and practical
						experience are required to evaluate the tools' output properly. </p>
					<p>Throughout the module, various security standards were discussed, which gave us an insight into
						which standards would be applied to our designated website. We pay more attention to GDPR
						directives and PCI-DSS as our eCommerce website offers an online payment. Besides the forum
						discussion with other classmates and a presentation on a GDPR case study, I created two mind
						maps to explore and summarise what I found on PCI-DSS and HIPPA. The output can be found in the
						artefacts section. Several logging and forensics tools/techniques were also introduced in the
						module. Logs and their impact on the business are essential sources in the process of analysing
						and identifying the incident. Unfortunately, I found these topics are essential but not
						applicable to our assignments. </p>
					<p>As a critical part of the module, we were tasked to design and perform a security assessment plan
						to evaluate the website assigned to the team previously. The goal was to identify and analyse
						security risks and vulnerabilities on the website and suggest a strategy to mitigate the issues.
						One of the challenges we faced when conducting the assessment was that the website blocked all
						the team members after a few automated scans. Sometimes we could simply navigate to the website
						and unblock ourselves through a gateway. However, using a VPN service would help bypass this
						challenge in most cases. Our final executive summary was conducted with heavy use of automated
						scanning tools, which I found, is a lack of human attention to verify or accurately determine
						potential web security vulnerabilities in an application. Automation tests are helpful. However,
						it is critical to get involved with the human factor to discover business logic issues. This
						executive summary was also a chance for us to apply the tutor's feedback on adding the
						reflection on the evaluation of tools, standards, and impacts linking to risk mitigation in the
						form of recommendations.</p>
					<p>In this module, the key element that I have learned is that information security management is
						much border than penetration testing. It covers not only the aspect of discovering the
						vulnerabilities and suggesting the mitigation strategy but also the entire process of training
						the staff to improve their security awareness, developing a security policy within the
						organisation to minimise the risks, and preparing a recovery plan to react to the incident
						quickly. This led me to further read about popular information security, cybersecurity, and
						privacy protection standards such as the ISO 27000 series. I am particularly interested in the
						NIST SP 800-53 requirements, as it was designed for security and privacy controls on US
						government agencies. Furthermore, federal information systems handle the most sensitive
						information, which impacts national security. A study by CSIS (2021) indicates that there have
						been significant cyber incidents on government agencies within the last decade, causing losses
						of more than a million dollars and the organisation's reputation.</p>
					<p>I found myself to be productive in this module, and it was fortunate for me to collaborate in a
						team where everyone has demonstrated their commitment to teamwork, which resulted in
						high-quality deliverables. Personally, because of the time zone difference, this was the very
						first module in the entire program that I had a chance to participate in the live seminars and
						attend the team meetings. This helped boost our team productivity quite a lot. Another aspect
						that I wish could have been available in this module is the ethics in security management.
						Cybersecurity professionals have access to the sensitive data that they are protecting. They
						must follow ethical principles and hold responsibility for the work they commit. Thus, ethics is
						an indispensable part of an information security management plan.</p>
