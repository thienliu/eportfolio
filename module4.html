                    <p>The Software Engineering Project Management module aims to provide students with an in-depth
                        understanding of the basic principles of Project Management and software engineering principles,
                        recognizing their relationship and interactions with other computing and design disciplines. We
                        had a chance to dive deeper into software development life cycles, examine the importance of
                        managing a project, and study a project manager's activities at each stage of the SDLC.</p>
                    <p>We initiated the design proposal early after the second week with a comparative table
                        illustrating the merits and drawbacks of applying the following models: Waterfall, V-Model,
                        Spiral, and Agile. I found myself to be most productive during the time we collaborated to
                        produce the design proposal. One teammate and I were responsible for creating the document's
                        outline and combining the contribution from others for the final submission as we agreed to take
                        the role of the technical writer during this process. I also initiated a Jira board, and the
                        team started segmenting the project into epics, user stories, and tasks. The team was struggling
                        at first, trying to understand the concepts behind those components and learning how to organize
                        everything in a logical and structured way.</p>
                    <p>Gathering requirement is one of the crucial engagement activities of any project planning.
                        Communication and negotiation skills play an essential role during this phase. On the one hand,
                        we can accept up to ten requirements to put into the design proposals as a development team. The
                        top five of those with the highest priority will be implemented for the demonstration. On the
                        other hand, as a customer team, we need to get as many requirements as possible accepted by the
                        developer team. Getting different points of view from both teams helped us to understand the
                        requirements and what we needed to achieve clearly.</p>
                    <p>During the first few weeks preparing for the mid-module assignment, I joined a collaborative
                        discussion on the most common reasons for a project failure. My initial post indicated that poor
                        project planning and execution, communication, and quality control are the leading causes, along
                        with the examples of IBM System 360, EDS-BSkyB CRM, and European Space Agency Ariane 5 to
                        support those points. Project management methodologies and techniques were also discussed to see
                        how they would help to remove the obstacles and support team collaboration. Learning from other
                        threads within the same topics, it is evident that a project may fail due to various reasons,
                        objectively or subjectively. However, it is complicated to determine the real reason for a
                        project failure. All the actors part of a project are interrelated and depend on each other. The
                        development and deployment of software systems is a multidimensional process where people and
                        technology are interconnected.</p>
                    <p>The objectives of any software are to provide the most efficient tool for the job. The software
                        itself is supposed to be easy to use, help promote the brand and engage with the customers. In
                        my professional career, I have co-conducted a few customers engagement workshops where we tried
                        to figure out what the customers need. Some activities that can be mentioned are: analyzing the
                        user data to extract the actual pain points that cause users problems, creating detailed
                        personas to describe whom we are building products for, ideation or brain-storming for getting
                        input and agreement from the whole team, working with scenarios and storyboards to describe how
                        we expect users to complete their tasks and see how the interaction between users and the system
                        happens. This module tasked us to examine another aspect of user experience management: human
                        emotions. Studying the CUR model by Minge & Thuring (2018) changed my experience research
                        mindset. From a developer's point of view, I focused on the instrumental qualities, which are
                        the functionalities of the software itself. However, non-instrumental qualities are essential
                        factors influencing customers' purchase decisions, not to mention other aspects such as
                        personality, lifestyle, and culture.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the modules, there were several other formative activities to explore the wide range
                        of techniques to measure and monitor the software development process, such as estimating,
                        planning, risk assessment, and quality control. In my opinion, the accuracy of these metrics
                        heavily depends on the project manager's experience and the development team.</p>
                    <p>I would admit that the most challenging part of this module is to figure out how to collaborate
                        effectively with everyone. Because of the time-zone difference, I can rarely attend live
                        seminars and team meetings. Thus, I must spend extra time catching up with the team using the
                        meeting notes where all team discussions and actionable items are located.</p>
