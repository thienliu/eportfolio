					<p>The Research Methods and Professional Practice module aims to provide students with a practical
						foundation in research methods. Various tools and techniques have been introduced to guide
						students in conducting research in a practical setting. We had a chance to discuss several codes
						of conduct and codes of ethics in order to gain essential insight into the legal, social, and
						ethical aspects of computing projects. As part of the module, we conduct a literature review on
						an approved topic, followed by a presentation of a topic of choice. The module structure can be
						divided into the following sections with the associated content.</p>

					<strong>Research Ethics</strong>
					<br></br>
					<p>From my observation, ethical topics were discussed throughout the module. We first review a few
						case studies provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) and compare them with the
						British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct in terms of the application of the ethics code to
						the situation we picked. It was a nice warmup as I can see there were plenty of interesting
						discussions in the forum. Another critical point of interest was that the students were not
						forced to pick sides by providing right or wrong answers. However, they were free to introduce
						local and international legislation in their response. In addition to the collaborative
						discussion, I wrote a <a target="_blank"
							href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWWXG_mtxZfGEfZ-iewW1ncwdWJTTfgr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114133206695404051099&rtpof=true&sd=true">blog
							post</a>
						on the topic of ethics in computing. In
						this post, I also mentioned “The checklist Manifesto” method, which helps avoid unintended
						consequences. This customisable checklist was proposed by Gawande A. (2010) and has been adopted
						by World Health Organization (WHO) in their Surgical Safety Checklist. Research by WHO shows
						that at least half of the cases where surgery caused harm are avoidable. (WHO, 2021). This is a
						positive result, and I think professionals and businesses in the technology industry should
						consider applying it in the workspace.</p>
					<strong>Research Methodologies</strong>
					<br></br>
					<p>Research methodologies are the core factor in conducting the literature review and research
						proposal later in this module. To effectively explore this topic, I first created the mind-maps
						on <a target="_blank"
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JE9qrughR6UPAymBNruz64y0eAVYyuvT/view?usp=sharing">how
							to design research questions</a> and <a target="_blank"
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JM-xiTx_yKefqSOS1tbVIlv5EreXan2H/view?usp=sharing">how
							to conduct a literature review</a> to summarise what I
						have learned. I did get some insight into different types of research design and research
						methods, and I realise that I have conducted some of those in my daily work without noticing the
						theoretical aspects behind them. For example, surveys and polls are used to ask for opinions or
						vote for a decision in my team. Customer interviews are regularly performed during the user
						experience workshop to identify what the client really needs and what needs to be built. From an
						engineering perspective, I approach the research in a different way. Usually, I will quickly
						build a prototype or a so-called minimum viable product (MVP) to evaluate the possibility and
						the technical challenges. In combination with the results from the client interviews, we
						consider the requirement and available resources, which contribute to producing a more accurate
						estimation for a project. Knowing a few more effective methods to better engage with the clients
						later is excellent.</p>
					<p>The questionnaire design activity was fun, and it reminded me of a project that I had done during
						the pandemic. We struggled to create a questionnaire to gather information about citizens’
						vaccination status to support their travel at the most convenient. The challenge was not to ask
						too many personal questions, but the gathered information must be valuable and accurate enough
						to prove identity. Because there were concerns about security and user data privacy, the
						government took over the project later. I would say it was an unforgettable moment to hop into
						that project.</p>
					<strong>Literature Review</strong>
					<br></br>
					<p>It was overwhelming initially as I did not know how to write a literature review and where to get
						started. I decided to take an Udemy course by (Hall 2019), which focuses on how to conduct and
						write a literature review. This course walked me through the entire process step by step and
						even suggested the basic structure to organise the sections in relevant order. In my opinion,
						the final submission was at an acceptable level. If I were to do it differently, I would pay
						more attention to the criticality criteria, where I would compare the theoretical proposed
						systems with the ‘real-world’ implementation to evaluate how effective they are in practice.
					</p>
					<strong>Statistical Exercises</strong>
					<br></br>
					<p>I would admit these exercises were a real challenge for me. I could not manage to finish them on
						time for formative feedback as I was busy with the research proposal outline. However, I still
						do not gain much knowledge from the exercise. I felt like I was doing a monkey job following the
						tutorials and applying the same formulas and steps to the exercises. I guess this is due to my
						lack of data analysis experience. Therefore, this is one of the skillsets that I desire to
						improve in the near future. </p>
					<strong>Research Proposal</strong>
					<br></br>
					<p>This assignment is a significant step toward my upcoming dissertation and also my favourite part
						as I have improved my presentation skills after finishing it. My topic of choice for the
						research proposal is a blockchain-related educational application. </p>
					<p>On the one hand, I find this topic interesting because blockchain is a new trend with no
						standardised implementation. There are opportunities to learn and discover this new technology.
						Even though blockchain is at its early age, there are many advantages that we can leverage from
						it, such as decentralisation, transparent governance, and genuine data. </p>
					<p>On the other hand, I have seen educational challenges during the pandemic, at least in my
						country. Teachers who have not been trained to conduct online lectures. Students who have not
						prepared for remote learning. (World Bank, 2019) indicates that, before the pandemic, the
						percentage of children who cannot read and understand at age 10 stood at 53% of children in low-
						and middle-income countries. The pandemic has the potential to worsen these numbers even more.
						If there is a solution to utilise an emerging technology to resolve the challenge, I would be
						more than happy to be a part of it.</p>
