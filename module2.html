                    <p>The Object-Oriented Information Systems module aims to critically evaluate the concepts and
                        principles of information systems as well as develop an object-oriented information system
                        design, implementing this knowledge in functional programming languages. The knowledge gained in
                        the module enables students to develop, implement and evaluate information technology solutions
                        to support business decision making.</p>
                    <p>I do not have a solid background in computer science as I am a self-taught software engineer. I
                        hoped this module would be an opportunity for me to revamp my knowledge about system design.
                        Throughout the module, what I have learned can be summarized into the following four items:</p>
                    <h3>1. Analytical skills</h3>
                    <p>The first three units were about getting to understand an information system and its core
                        components. I found the first forum discussion interesting. All the students were supposed to
                        identify an example of information system failure, focusing on the failure’s reasons, sharing
                        and discussing with others. With many cases brought up by other students and discussion among
                        those topics, this activity clearly showed that the problem is not only caused by inappropriate
                        design and implementation, but human errors in operating the system is another essential aspect
                        that we need to manage thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p>These units also gave me a chance to review the system development life cycle. Even this practice
                        has been there for decades, and I personally think Agile methodology is more practical in terms
                        of software development. For example, in Agile, the team can quickly experiment and adjust a
                        feature without having any big impact on the project. Whereas, to change the scopes or
                        requirements using the traditional system development approach, everything should go through
                        planning, design, development, testing, and deployment once over again. It’s time-consuming and
                        not budget effective.</p>
                    <h3>2. Python, UML, Database design and principles</h3>
                    <p>The subsequent three units covered the introduction to Python programming language and UML, with
                        practical activities. These units were easy to follow. Even though I learned valuable knowledge
                        about different types of diagrams and when and how to use them during the system design process,
                        I was not confident enough as most examples were so simple. I was not sure how to put everything
                        in place when designing at an enterprise level. There was another intermediate unit to help
                        students get familiar with database design principles and their relationship to object-oriented
                        design. This is an indispensable piece when it comes to designing the class diagram. However,
                        from what I have learned from the unit, I see a missing part here because we were not discussing
                        the custom data type such as structures and enumerations, which we use a lot in real-world
                        applications.</p>
                    <p>We also revisited the core concepts of SQL and investigated the key elements of an
                        entity-relationship diagram (ERD). I must confess that I learned the most from the collaborative
                        activity during these units. I have little knowledge of NoSQL before this module. I have done a
                        few projects using Google Firebase and MongoDB in my professional career just by following the
                        documentation. The discussion led me to another interesting topic: Elastic Search. The way they
                        built Elastic Search really impresses me. There are only three basic concepts behind the scenes:
                        index, node, cluster. Its scalability and failover mechanisms are other aspects that convince me
                        to spend more time on this topic in the future</p>
                    <h3>3. Practically design an information system</h3>
                    <p>Gathering up all the knowledge we have acquired from the previous units, our first assignment was
                        tasked to design a software system for an online store. It was difficult because I had to think
                        about the big picture of how online e-commerce works and be selective on what to bring into the
                        design. I have researched Amazon and other local existing e-commerce systems, in combination
                        with the assignment requirements to produce a final version to focus on the process of the
                        customer completing an order. My submission received helpful feedback from the tutor, indicating
                        my knowledge gaps in object inheritance and how to use the diagram properly. I realized there is
                        much room for improvement here.</p>
                    <h3>4. Implement an information system using Python and Flask</h3>
                    <p>Both Python and Flask are new to me. As I followed some online courses, I was so confused in the
                        first place because there are many ways to set up and structure a flask application. The best
                        practices are to modularize the code into sub-packages/folders to reduce the maintenance effort
                        later. The other approach that can be considered is to apply the MVC pattern. MVC stands for
                        Model-View-Controller, where each component is responsible for a specific task: the model is a
                        wrapper of data, the view represents the user interface, while the controller is an intermediary
                        between the model and the view. MVC should be carefully used as it is easy to become a massive
                        view controller when the controller takes too many responsibilities as the application grows.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was surprised by how easy it was to support template inheritance and develop reusable UI
                        components using Jinja during the development phase. I have tried to integrate React with Flask.
                        Even they can co-exist in the same projects, and I ended up using Jinja as I think it is better
                        to use built-in components instead of spending more time learning additional
                        frameworks/libraries like React. </p>
                    <p>Choosing the right database was another factor that concerned me, as there are various available
                        options to work well with Python. PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite are the most recommended
                        open-source databases for Python web applications. However, I have decided to get my hand dirty
                        on something different: SQLAlchemy. Its data model’s relationship seems to be easy at first with
                        a combination of foreign key and backref setup. However, things become more complicated when
                        using model inheritance as it requires more matching arguments to get everything up and run.
                        Database schema migration is another aspect we need to take care of when working with, as the
                        application may stop working when new attributes are added to the data model. There are several
                        available third-party tools to achieve this, such as flask_migrate or Alembic. Those will
                        require extra work to enable database migration in our web app.</p>
